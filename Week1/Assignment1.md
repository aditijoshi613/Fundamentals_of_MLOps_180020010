Part 1:
1. In the notes of Week 1, we compared & contrasted MLOps with DevOps. In this question, you need to understand what is meant by the term ***AIOps***, & then contrast it with MLOps.

Answer: 

       1. AIOps means using Artificial Intelligence for optimization, simplification, acceleration and mainly, automation of IT Operations. Whereas MLOps helps us build, scale and deploy machine learning algorithms to production reliably and efficiently. 
       
       
       2. AIOps utilizes big data, advanced analytics, and machine learning techniques for achieveing the above goal. Whereas MLOps utilizes the concepts of ML, DevOps & Data Engineering for providing the above metntioned utility. 
       
       3. MLOps provides tools and techniques for efficient deployment of models to production, whereas AIOps is more about which of these tools are automated in order to simplify the process. 
       
       4. MLOps facilitates collaboration between different teams, whereas AIOps helps them improve their IT infrastructure.
